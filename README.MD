GDNative library that plays mp3 and chiptune music files.
The project uses GameMuseEmu, Minimp3 and libsoundio

Notes:
-Currently a lot of things are hardcoded like the sample rate(44100) and the sound format (S16LE), I think these settings work  on any hardware but I might be wrong.
-mp3 files must have a constant bitrate.
